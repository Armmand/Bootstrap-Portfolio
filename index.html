   <p>My name is Armmand Alston and I was born in Durham, North Carolina on April 2, 1988. I lived in Chapel Hill for a short period of time before moving to Southern Pines, North Carolina at the age of five.
      While in middle school I was highly involved in sports playing soccer, basketball, and track. By the time high school came around I was awarded a full athletic scholarship to The O’Neil high school in Southern Pines North Carolina. During this time I mostly focused on running track.
       I along with  several of my teammates won a couple of state titles during my time at O’Neil. After graduating from high school I started working towards my associates in criminal justice at Sandhills Community College. After completing his degree Armmand began his 8 years career in policing.
       I currently reside in Durham, North Carolina with a wife and an eleven month old son. </P>
   <p>I also love cars and motorcycles.</p>
